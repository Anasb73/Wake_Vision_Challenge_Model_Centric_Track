The changes made to the original model:

The architechture of the model which is inspired from the blaze face model from th paper : "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.05047" I tested to optimized version of this model without residual networks one with and the other without using double blocks.
The best model is trained for a small number of epochs (around 5) and achieve 76% Accuracy.
